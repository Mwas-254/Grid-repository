      for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. 
      The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing 
      the course, I‚Äôve successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ‚Äù</p>

      <b><p class="">Such a life-changing experience. Highly recommended!</p></b>
       <p class="">‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
        student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff 
        did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team 
        project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial 
        could ever have. In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent 
        experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 
        100% recommend! ‚Äù</p>

       <p class="para">Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and 
          learning from their experiences was easy.</p>
       <p class="para">‚Äú The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress which I find really refreshing. The program 
         gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable 
         junior developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you need from 
         an incredible community of smart and amazing people. ‚Äù</p>
